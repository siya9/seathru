# Underwater image enhancement using Sea-Thru algorithm on monocular images

Exploring underwater environments is crucial for underwater archaeology, marine resource research, and numerous other purposes. Images and videos are particularly important for underwater exploration due to their non-intrusive nature and ability to capture high-information content. However, light attenuation and back-scattering underwater often cause image distortion. When light enters the water, it gets refracted, absorbed, and scattered, causing images underwater to become dull and distorted. 


# How to run 
Enter the following command to execute the Python code code:
py seathru-mono --image input_folder --output output_folder
